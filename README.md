# Tensor-Flow-Machine-Learning
We are training a .tflite model for use on the rev hub, we are importing a provided data set from the ftc-ml online tool.

Information:
  The architecture of the outputted .tflite model is: 
  
  The data set layout is: "The datasets are downloaded as one or more zip files. The zip files contain TensorFlow record files."(https://community.ftclive.org/t/downloading-datasets/34)
  
To do:
  Successfully import data set
  Determine Architecture
  Train from architecture
